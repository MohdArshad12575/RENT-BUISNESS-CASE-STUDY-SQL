# Bike Rental Shop - SQL Case Study

## Introduction
Emily is the shop owner, and she would like to gather data to help her grow the business. She has hired you as an SQL specialist to get the answers to her business questions, such as:
- How many bikes does the shop own by category?
- What was the rental revenue for each month?

The answers are hidden in the database. You just need to figure out how to extract them using SQL.
